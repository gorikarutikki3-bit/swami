This is a static website for a personalized birthday dashboard.

## How to Deploy with GitHub Pages

1. **Create a new public repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it (e.g., `swami-birthday-site`)

2. **Upload your files**
   - Add all files from your project:
     - `index.html` (homepage)
     - `children_page.htm`
     - `dashboard.html`
     - `images/` folder (all images)
     - Any other assets

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repo’s **Settings** > **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select your branch (usually `main`) and `/ (root)` folder
   - Click **Save**

4. **Get your public link**
   - After 1-2 minutes, your site will be live at:
     `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   - Share this link with anyone!

## Tips
- Your homepage must be named `index.html`.
- All images and linked files should be in the same folder or subfolders.
- You can update files anytime; changes will be live in 1-2 minutes.
